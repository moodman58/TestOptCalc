- Prompt the user if they want to enter data for a motor+prop combination.
- Ask for the name of the motor
- Take in the thrust and power value pairs.
- Generate the coefficients of the polynomial.
- To accomplish this, please create a class called "PowerSystem" or something along those lines, the class should have attributes for: string motor_name, float propeller_size, int battery_cell_count, 
list thrust_values, list power_values, list poly_coefficients.
- Add a method to the class to take in the thrust power pairs, and add a private method to generate the coefficients of the polynomial
- Make sure to save all the objects created from this class (maybe pickle them) so that the user will NOT have to input the data again each time.

r"""HOW TO USE
    TEXT FILE SETUP
   Make a text file with the first line as the motor name(should be exact), following lines containing the thrust,power pairs(example:1900,2400). One pair per line. When done entering all pairs type "end"
   in the next line. Save your text file and open it in your current working space. You may need to change the text file location at line number 39 depending on how you are running python. 
   Simple way to do this is just to check your current working space(mine is displayed in the terminal as: C:\Users\mehmo\.cursor-tutor), and then checking the location of your text file.
   Mine is in: C:\Users\mehmo\.cursor-tutor\projects\python             
   Therefore my file location specified on line 39 is :"projects\python\{}.txt" --> Ignore the {} its just for coding purposes.

    USING PROGRAM:
        After clicking run, the program will prompt you to choose between 3 options: Enter a new motor/propeller pair, check info on an existing motor/propeller, quit the program. To choose type
        1, 2 or 3, respectively. Entering a motor/propeller pair will allow you to enter info on the motors name, propellars size, and battery cell count. The program will then display info about 
        the quadratic equation(Ax^2 + Bx + C) that can describe the (Thrust,Power) data points. The program will provide estimated values of A, B, and C. Option 2 will allow you to type in the name
        of the motor that already has been inputted into the program, and then the program will show you the information about that motor. Lastly, Option 3 will exit you from the program.
        
    DOWNLOADING scipy AND matplotlib
        https://scipy.org/install/ --> Basically in your cmd type 'python -m pip install scipy' *pip must be installed

        https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html --> Basically in your cmd type 'python -m pip install -U matplotlib' *pip must be installed

        If these commands dont work you can download Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download and follow the guide on  https://scipy.org/install/ and https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html
